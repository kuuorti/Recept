    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Recipe for making delicious homemade samsa from puff pastry. The dough is prepared very quickly and turns out to be unrealistically delicious,
        but the stuffing from minced meat is beyond praise! I am happy to share the recipe of samsa!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For the test:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheat flour - 0.5 kg</li>
            <li>Butter - 100 g</li>
            <li>Salt - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Chicken egg - 1 pc.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the filling:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Minced meat - 0.6 kg</li>
            <li>Onion - 2 pcs .</li>
            <li>Salt - 0.5 teaspoons</li>
        </ul>
   </ul>
   <h2>Cooking stage</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>
           Knead the dough as on dumplings. To do this, add salt water to the sifted flour.
             Knead the dough well and let it rest for at least half an hour.
       </li>
       <li>
        While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. To do this, add salt, pepper and finely chopped onion to the minced meat.
       </li>
       <li>
        Roll out the rested dough thinly and smear its surface with melted butter, twist the dough into a sausage. For convenience, cut the sausage into several parts and scroll through each part a little (without fanaticism).
         Put the sausages in the freezer for an hour.
       </li>
       <li>
        After an hour, take out the dough, cut it into equal parts and roll out the cakes for the future samsa. If you did everything correctly, then the pattern will be visible on the surface of the cakes.
        To make homemade samsa from puff pastry look beautiful and appetizing, put the cakes with the pattern down.
       </li>
       <li>
        On each tortilla we spread the stuffing from the minced meat and carefully blind the ends.
       </li>
       <li>
        We spread the samsa on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, 
        smear the samsa with egg and put it in the oven, preheated to 200 degrees, for 30-40 minutes.
       </li>
       <li>
        Delicious homemade samsa is ready! Bon appetit to everyone!
